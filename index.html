      <h1>Will You be my Valentine? 🤗</h1>
      <p>Hello love,

        I can’t believe it’s already been two months since I mustered the courage to ask you to be my girlfriend. 🥹 It’s not like I’m keeping count or anything 😅—it just crossed my mind.
        
        First, I just want to say: you’re amazing. 💖 It’s been so long since I’ve been with someone, so sometimes I find myself unsure about what to do in certain situations. I worry—I don’t know if I’m doing too much or too little, but at the end of the day, all I care about is you being happy. 🥰
        
        Long distance sucks (you know I’ve never been a fan of it), but as long as it’s with you, I’m willing to make it work. Even if things aren’t exactly the same as when we first started talking, you’re still incredible, and I love you for it. ❤️
        
        To be honest, I didn’t know this was something boyfriends had to do 😅, but here we are. So… would you be my Valentine? 💌🌹</p>
